//macro aims to generate a line profile from a single 8-bit grayscale skeleton (any values >1) on black
//by eating the line starting from the leftmost end,
//and building a memory of the line while it's eating.
//then it measures that sequence in the original and lists everything.
//line can be convoluted but not touching itself

//it depends on having 1 skeleton line in the picture
